# Post-Phase Plugin Deploy

After every phase execution completes (after verification passes), build and install the plugin binaries:

```bash
cmake --build build --target ChordPumper
cp build/ChordPumper_artefacts/CLAP/ChordPumper.clap ~/.clap/ChordPumper.clap
rm -rf ~/.vst3/ChordPumper.vst3
cp -r build/ChordPumper_artefacts/VST3/ChordPumper.vst3 ~/.vst3/ChordPumper.vst3
```

- VST3 is a directory bundle — always `rm -rf` before `cp -r` to avoid nesting
- CLAP is a single file — simple `cp` overwrite
- Run with `required_permissions: ["all"]` since `~/.clap` and `~/.vst3` are outside the workspace
