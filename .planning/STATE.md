# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** The morphing grid — play a chord, see what comes next, follow the thread.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Plugin Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Plugin Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Plugin Foundation | 1 | 7 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 7min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 21 requirements; Phases 4 & 5 parallelizable
- [Roadmap]: Voice leading (CHRD-03) grouped with morph engine (Phase 4) — both define the chord transition experience
- [Roadmap]: Linux DnD feasibility spike in Phase 5; clipboard/file-export fallback planned
- [01-01]: Added C language to project() — JUCE/CJE internals require C compiler; CMake 4.x errors without it
- [01-01]: Created placeholder .cpp files — CMake 4.x validates source file existence at configure time
- [01-01]: Plugin categorized as Instrument (IS_SYNTH TRUE) with MIDI output — user locked decision

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Linux drag-and-drop from embedded plugin windows is unreliable (X11). Phase 5 must validate feasibility early and have a fallback.
- Morph algorithm is novel — no reference implementation. Phase 4 will need iterative tuning.
