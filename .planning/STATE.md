## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 21 requirements; Phases 4 & 5 parallelizable
- [Roadmap]: Voice leading (CHRD-03) grouped with morph engine (Phase 4) — both define the chord transition experience
- [Roadmap]: Linux DnD feasibility spike in Phase 5; clipboard/file-export fallback planned

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Linux drag-and-drop from embedded plugin windows is unreliable (X11). Phase 5 must validate feasibility early and have a fallback.
- Morph algorithm is novel — no reference implementation. Phase 4 will need iterative tuning.
